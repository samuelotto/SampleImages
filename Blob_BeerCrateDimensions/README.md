## Industries:
* Beverage


## Task
Before the bottles are lifted into the beer crate, the crate must be checked for deformation and damage to avoid a crash.

## Solution:
The top edge of the beer crate is highlighted with external lighting so that the position of each blob can be used for measurement.

# Blob Level Check

# Industries:#
* Beverage


## Task
After filling the beer bottle, the fill level is checked. The product and the bottle colour play a decisive role here.

## Solution:
### Illumination: 
Transmitted light is obviously the best choice to detect the product level in the bottle, thereby backlight is the right choice. But illumination color has a significant effect on the transparency of the bottles.

### LevelCheck:
Define small ROI vertical to the liquid surface and use the blob position to evaluate the filling level
